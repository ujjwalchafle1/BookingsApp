JustPark iOS Technical Test
===========================

We have created a small technical test for you to showcase how you work. Your task will be to create an iOS application that shows drivers a list of their bookings and the details of anyone booking when they tap into it.

Challenge
---------

Retrieve and display a driver's booking results from the following query:

https://justpark-hiring-json-api.herokuapp.com/api/bookings

Retrieve the details of a booking when tapped and create a view to display the details of the bookings to the driver

https://justpark-hiring-json-api.herokuapp.com/api/booking/:id

There is no authentication required to use these endpoints.

Requirements
------------
- Your code must be in Swift, using UIKit framework compatible with iOS12 onward
- It must compile and run in the iPhone Simulator across various sized devices
- Consider how you might scale the app in the future and how the chosen architect will affect this
- We want to see how you would approach UI/UX, and will be evaluating the app for creativity and quality of the user interface and experience
- You must test your code to a level you deem acceptable
- Write a readme on how you approached the work and what you considered during development

To aid the development process, we've supplied several assets used within the current app, which can be found in the assets folder.


Extra points
------------
- It's not required but some use of RxSwift or Observable properties would be good to see
- At JustPark we create our views in code rather than XIB or Storyboards, so it would be good to see you have a strong grip on programmatic view construction
- Any Animation will be a bonus
- Feel free to use any dependencies you deem necessary to execute your solution

If you have any questions, email us, and we can add to this readme.

Good luck!
